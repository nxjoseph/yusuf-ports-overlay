durationpy library is a Python module that provides functionality to convert
between Python's datetime.timedelta objects and Go's Duration strings.
This is useful when you need to interact with systems or data formats that
use Go's duration format, which is a string-based representation of time
intervals (e.g., "2h30m15s"). The library allows you to parse Go duration
strings into Python timedelta objects and format timedelta objects back
into Go duration strings.
