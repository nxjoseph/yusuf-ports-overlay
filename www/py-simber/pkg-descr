Simber was merely built because of some restrictions that
the Python's default logging library has. This library is
aimed as a simple, minimal yet powerful logging library for
all Python apps. This logging library aims to take away all
the disadvantages of using the default logging library and
at the same time be feature filled so that
the end user feels powerful using it.
